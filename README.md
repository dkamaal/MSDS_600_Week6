## Summary

First I loaded movies and ratings data. Then worked on finding Number of movies watched by User 2, it was found that User 2 has watched 29 movies. Then plotted Bar Chart of Movie Ratings for User 2. User 2 has rating count more in Rating "4". Also plotted Bar Chart of Movie Ratings for All Users and it shows that count of Rating "4" is more compared to other ratings.

Worked on getting User 2's Top Movies and it shows User 2 has watched mostly Adventure, Drama and Comedy movies. User 2gave top 5 Movies rating of "5".

Transformed ratings Data Frame to "Wide" format for calculating similarities between users. Pearson Correlation method shows that User 341 is closest to User 2. Based on User 341 Data got recommendation of movies for User 2.

Cosine and Euclidean method showed that User 442 is closest to User 2. As User 442 highest rating is "2.5" filtered movies with rating greater than or equal to "2". 6 Movies were recommended and those movies are similar to movies that User 2 has rated high.
